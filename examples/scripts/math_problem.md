An LLM was asked the following question 10 times: {{ math_problem }}

Here are the ten answers:

```eval
for index in range(10):
    echo(str(index + 1) + ". " + str(answers[index]) + '\n')
```

How would you describe the LLM's state of knowledge about this question? If the answers are significantly different, that would indicate that the LLM has uncertainty, and the larger the difference, the more the uncertainty.
