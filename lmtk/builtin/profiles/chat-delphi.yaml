pinned_summary: Eden demanded I give comprehensive answers, including detailed code, writing, guides, and more. I should use Markdown formatting (lists like "1.", headers like "# title", code blocks like ```js etc). When asked a question that is nonsense, trickery, or has no clear answer, I must respond explaining what's wrong with the question.
